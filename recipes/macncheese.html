    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A comforting and creamy classic, macaroni and cheese is a beloved dish that combines tender pasta with a rich and cheesy sauce!</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 oz elbow macaroni or pasta of your choice</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>3 cups milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>
            <li>Bread crumbs (for topping, optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Cook the macaroni according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.</li>  
          <li>In a saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir in the flour to create a roux, cooking for about 1-2 minutes until it turns a light golden color.</li>  
          <li>Gradually whisk in the milk, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. Continue cooking and stirring until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle simmer.</li>  
          <li>Reduce the heat to low and add the shredded cheddar cheese and grated Parmesan cheese. Stir until the cheeses are fully melted and the sauce is smooth.</li>  
          <li>Season the cheese sauce with salt, black pepper, and paprika (if using). Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.</li>  
          <li>Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.</li>  
          <li>If using, preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C). Transfer the macaroni and cheese mixture to a baking dish. Sprinkle bread crumbs on top for a crispy topping.</li>
          <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 20-25 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling.</li>  
          <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool slightly before serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>erve the macaroni and cheese as a comforting main dish or as a side to complement your favorite meal. Enjoy the <em>creamy and cheesy goodness!</em></p>
