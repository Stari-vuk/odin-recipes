            </ul>
            <li>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>In a bowl, combine ricotta cheese, egg, chopped parsley, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Mix well to create a creamy mixture.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Assemble the Lasagna:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a greased 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
                <li>Place three lasagna noodles on top of the sauce.</li>
                <li>Spread half of the ricotta mixture over the noodles.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle about 1/3 of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the ricotta layer.</li>
                <li>Repeat the layers: meat sauce, noodles, ricotta mixture, mozzarella cheese.</li>
                <li>Top with a final layer of meat sauce, remaining shredded mozzarella cheese, and grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Add Béchamel Sauce:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Carefully pour the béchamel sauce over the top layer of cheese. Use a spatula to spread it evenly.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Bake the Lasagna:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, tenting it slightly to prevent the cheese from sticking.</li>
                <li>Bake in the preheated oven for about 25 minutes.</li>
                <li>Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and bubbling.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Serve:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Remove the lasagna from the oven and let it rest for about 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set and makes it easier to cut into neat portions</li>
                <li>Serve the lasagna with a side salad and some crusty bread for a complete meal.</li>
            </ul>
